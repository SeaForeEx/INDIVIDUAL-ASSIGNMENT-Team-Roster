<strong>Join The X-Men</strong>

Join the X-Men is an app that was built from the Team Roster App Template.  It is based on the X-Men from the 90s.

Here's the Netlify link: https://join-the-xmen-c4.netlify.app/

Join the X-Men is an App that deals with Teams and Members.  Both of these groups of data are accessed and manipulated on the DOM with full CRUD techniques.

This App was coded with JavaScript React and its helper Next.js.

Join the X-Men uses Google Authentication to let a user have their own private set of data that no one else can access.  A unique id (called uid) is generated upon the first login and this prevents other users from seeing your set of X-Men and X-Teams.

Only you can Create Read Update and Delete your members and/or teams.

Shouts to my teachers for answering tickets and pushing me to work harder on this project than ever before!

And a SPECIAL shoutout to the greatest Group that has ever been formed in the history of NSS Cohorts.

The one

The only

DEDE'S NUTS!

These men have been amazing to work with, our teamwork only grows stronger as we work on projects both group and individual.  We all truly bonded over the last few projects and have come to enjoy helping each other work out coding issues or just listen to each other's life stories.  We cried over tickets or cried until we could laugh no more.

I'd code to the ends of the earth with these guys.

I love being in this cohort.

P.S.: There is a secret page somewhere in this project, a dastardly mystery that I couldn't help but leave to the user to solve and discover on their own...
